                The Paleozoic is an incredibly interesting time when life diversified in ways we have never seen again. 
                It often gets overshadowed by the Mesozoic and its awe inspiring dinosaurs, but the Paleozoic still is no slouch either when it comes to cool creatures. 
                In fact did you know that while pop culture and movies often depict the dimetrodon alongside dinosaurs such as t-rex and triceratops it actually existed some 
                40 million years before dinosaurs were even a concept.

                    <h4>The Cambrian Explosion</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Cambrian Explosion was a period that corresponded to that start of the Cambrian and lasted roughly 40 million years, with the 
                        largest changes taking place over roughly 15 million years, incredibly fast from a geological point of view. It constituted a rapid and 
                        widespread diversification in all life that resulted in the exploration of new habitats, increases in body size, changing body plans AKA morphologies, 
                        development of specialized organs, new species relationships, and was when
                         many of earth's modern phyla first developed including arthropods, mollusks, annelids, echinoderms, and chordates (our group).

                    <h4>Supercontinent</h4>
                    <p>
                        The supercontinent Gondwana held most of the landmass in the southern hemisphere, made up of part of modern 
                        day South America, Africa, Antarctica, Australia, and India covering roughly one fifth of the earth's surface.

                    <h4>Armour Appears</h4>
                    <p>
                        Armored animals first appeared, dominating this period, such as the Trilobite, 
                        a marine armoured arthropod which would live on for millions of years without much 
                        evolutionary change only going extinct at the very end of the Paleozoic 280-300 million years later.

                    <h4>Mass Extinction</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Cambrian period experienced several smaller extinction events, periodically turning much of the ocean into an 
                        ecological dead zone, but was finally ended by a large extinction event 485 million years ago. 
                        Although it is unsure what exactly caused it, it is believed that volcanic activity and changing oceanic conditions played a large part.

                    <h4>The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Basically the cambrian explosion all over again. 
                        biodiversity once again took over as after the last mass extinction there were many empty positions in the ecosystem that needed to be 
                        filled. Replacing much of the Cambrian biodiversity with new Ordovician fauna.

                    <p>
                        Plants make the difficult journey onto land, at this point there are no trees or grasses, only small, low to the ground mosses other non vascular plants.

                        Armour and hard shells remained an incredibly viable body structure for the Ordovician, namely the molluscs and arthropods, 
                        who dominated the oceans during this time. This can be seen for example in the very successful line of sea scorpions such as

                        The end of the Ordovician was marked by an absolutely massive extinction, dubbed one of the “big five” mass extinction events. 
                        This event wiped out approximately 85% of all life on earth. Making it the second deadliest mass extinction in recorded history. 
                        It occurred in multiple phases, first being hit by a global cooling event, then a global warming event, finally oxygen depletion caused by plant life at the time also played a role.

                        One of the "big five" mass extionction the Great Dying was the largest mass extinction in history. In this event
                        an estimated 90% of all species and 96% of ocean species died out. A near global reset wipping out entire ecosystems top-to-bottom.
